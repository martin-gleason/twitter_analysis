# Twitter Analysis
An attempt to make a network and sentiment analysis tool with R. Eventually, there will be a [shiny](https://shinyapps.io) component; however, these early stages are about creating ways to automate collection and storage in a PostgreSQL database.

The packages used to date are:

• The Tidyverse
• RPostgreSQL
